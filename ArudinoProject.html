    When thinking about a project to make my partner and I were stuck on where to being. We then thought of music we could be playing through the piezo buzzer. After thinking for a while we thought of playing Despacito. After looking online for some time we found a working code for the song. After this, we began tweaking the song to our liking until we have what we have today. When trying to find out what song we would like to do we came to a dilemma. There where many songs to choose from when looking online for the correct song. After trial and error, we found a Despacito code which was compatible with the parts we had and was playing the parts of the song we intended to use. The finding of the arduino song was done by me and it took a class period to find. Other problem we were faced with was when we trying to hook up the parts to the arduino. We wanted to make the song play while a LED was blinking to the song. At first we were confused because it did not use the port we were intending it to use. After playing around with the code and the parts, we were able to get the light to blink to the corresponding music.

    Our project is of recreating one of the greatest songs in history. This song being Despacito. For this we used a piezo buzzer that we hooked up to our arduino. We then programed it to play the song once it gets power. Although it only plays apart of the song, the listener gets to truly experience what Despacito could be made into.
