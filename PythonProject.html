    <h2>My working game</h2>
    <p>
        For our python project my partner and I decided to make a one account ATM machine. One of the processes which we included was a deposit and withdraw function. With the deposit function the user is allowed to deposit a certain amount of money into their account. With the withdrawal function the user is allowed withdraw the amount of money which is in their account. One of the difficulties which was involved was trying to make it so that the user was not allowed to type anything that is not a number. To resolve this problem I asked for help. This lead me to learn a new function called “try and expect”. With this I was able to make it that so that it would try their input and if it did not equal a number, it would state that it was an invalid input. This cleared the problem of it breaking when anything besides a number. This is was coded by me.

      This is my code. It is a single account ATM achine. With it you are allowed to deposit, withdraw, balance, and transfer money. When you deposit money you are allowed to deposit any amount of money you wish to deposit. With withdrawing money you can withdraw as much money as you have in your bank account. With transfering you can transfer any amount of money as long you have enough. With checking you balance it will show you your balance.
