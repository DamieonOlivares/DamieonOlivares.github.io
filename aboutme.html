      <p>Hello my name is Damieon Olivares and I attend Palm Desert High School.  Once I graduate I plan to attend a college of my choosing which is located in state.  I would like to attend the University of San Diego or the University of Irvine.  While in college I plan on majoring in computer programing.  To achieve this goal I plan on studying hard and also devoting all of my time to my school work.  I have always wanted to go into computer programing. 
      </p>
       <p>
        One of the most important characteristic for this type of job would be patience.  Patience would be important for a computer programer because of the time it would take you to start and finish your code.  This would also be important because your code could never be done, meaning that there will always be things that could be fixed.  Another important characteristic that I possess for job like this is to be organized.  This would mean being on task and also having your time managed.  Being that this is a computer programing job you have to be organized with your code and with your time, making sure that you make due dates.
       </p>
      <p>
        The major achievement that I have achieved in high school so far include being on the Robotics teams and placing high in our Global tournament.  I have been apart of only two clubs durning high school which include Botball and Youth Court.  From my being in my Youth Court club I can say that I learned how to be very responsible and professional when it came time to present a case.  From being in Botball club I learned how to use my creativity and create working components from my robot from lego pieces and metal.  From taking one AP class and five honors classes my sophomore year I have learned how to manage my time wisely.
      </p>
      <p>
        To conclude, I possess all of the characteristics in order to become the computer programer I strive to be.  I would like to thank you for your time and also please feel free look at at my site for a little while longer.
