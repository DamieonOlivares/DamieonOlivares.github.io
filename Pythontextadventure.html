  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>Characters: 
Pewdiepie
T-Series
Dustin Longfries
Rustin Earthsear
Wustin Groundcrisp
</p>

<p>Setting: 
2112
Dystopia world where T-Series had taken over
</p>

<p>Pewdiepie v. T-Series
In the year 2020 T-Series had won the long fight against Pewdiepie in the subscriber war.  This lead entire populations to panic and slowly fall apart. T-Series took this advantage of this and started sending out troops one army at a time. This lead many countries to give up their power to him. By the year 2075 T-Series had gained total control over the entire world having no place unconquered. After his humiliating defeat, Pewdiepie and the remaining bros retreated into the underground Bro-Cave in Antarctica. They waited here for 55 years, doing nothing but meme reviews and eating his play buttons. However, the day he heard the news that T-Series had gained total control of the world, he vowed to destroy T-Series and restore the world to its former glory. With this in mind he sets off to Youtube headquarters in India to defeat T-Series once and for all. On his way out of the Bro-Cave he was greeted by the Dustin Longfries, the elder of the group, and was given a weapon that could help him in his fate-deciding battle. This weapon was a gauntlet able to provide him with the most powerful brofist ever to exist. Shortly after obtaining this, he set off on his journey to defeat T-Series. On his journey his faced many obstacles, which gave T-Series more time to build up his empire. As he gained more subscribers his empire grew and also his power.  Within a week of his departure, Pewdiepie had arrived. He entered Youtube HQ, a towering, 100 level skyscraper. He entered the building greeted by the front desk employee Wustin Groundcrisp. Groundcrisp then approached Pewdiepie and swung his fist at his face.  Dodging the attack, Pewdiepie then flicked Groundcrisp and send him to his grave. He then began climbing the floors, and with each floor came a harder enemy, until finally he reached the 100th floor. When first entering he was first greeted by T-Series’s manservant Rustin Earthsear.  At first glance Rustin immediately pulled the secret alarm in the building.  This alarm notifies everyone in the building to evacuate.  Pewdiepie then proceeded to fight him, which lead to Rustin’s death. After disposing of Rustin’s body he proceeded to the next room where the true challenge lies.  He entered the room, and there was T-Series waiting for him. T-Series then greeted Pewdiepie and then threw the first attack. Almost not dodging it, Pewdiepie was forced onto his stomach. Then out of the blue, Pewdiepie get punched in the face with T-Series’s diamond encrusted knuckle brace.  Pewdiepie walks then gathers the rest of the strength he has, walk up to T-Series and punches him out the window. T-Series, feeling motionless, rememences his well lived life and falls head first onto the sidewalk.  With his victory, Pewdiepie restored the world back to its former glory and made sure to delete T-Series Youtube channel.

             <p> In my game you play as Pewdiepie and you have to defeat T-Series.  You start off by traveling from a secret Bro-Cave located in the North Pole.  You then have to make a decision right off the bat. This decides whether or not you continue with the game. If you choose to take the gauntlet you progress with the game, while if you do not talke the gauntlet you get attacked the first person you see. You then are met with the challenge of fighting againist the front desk person. Once defeated you walk 100 floors to face off againist T-Series' assistant. You are forced to fight him at this point. Once taken down you are met with the final challenge of defeating T-Series himself. Once defeated the world restored back to normal and you are the hero.</p>

    <h2>Written Response</h2>
    <p>When creating our program we wanted to do a silly story with a lot of made up characters. We then thought of a current event that is happening on Youtube at the moment. Pewdiepie vs T-Series is an ongoing war between two Youtube channels. Their prize is having the most amount of subscribers on the platform. Currently Pewdiepie is in the lead with a million subscribers over T-Series. We found this to be a perfect subject to write our story on, so we decided to go with this. While programing we ran into two problems with our code.  One of the problems that we faced when coding our story was with coding. With some of the code it would not work property. When ran it would not progress in the story when the player made his/her choice.  We solved this problem by looking at our code very closely. We had our code looping with itself. Another problem we encountered was with the story. We originally made it too short. To compensate for this I extended the program and the story. This made go from four choices to seven choices.</p>
