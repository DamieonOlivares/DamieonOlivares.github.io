    When we first started on the Hangman app in class I really wanted to expand it even further.  Two features I wanted to add to the Hangman was a timer and changing pictures.  When I first wanted to develop my app, I wanted a timer to challenge the user and make them think faster.  I used the original code for when we added the number of "Tries Left" and made it so that when the timer hit zero, it would take me to the fail screen.  With making this, I also had to subtract from the initial time given.  Another element I added to my app to make it different from the base project was to add a picture and also link that picture to the corresponding word.  This then had me make another ordered list and make it so that the word and the picture correspond with each other, rather than having it choose a random picture and word.  One of the difficulties I encountered was that my app kept adding underscores rather than getting rid of the and replacing them with a letter.  To fix this I had looked through my code about a dozen times, and after having Mr. Landfried look at it I was adding underscores instead of subtracting them.  This then solved my problem and the app was working as intended.  I developed this app independently and did not collaborate with anyone.
